The SQL_project.pdf file contains the code and description of the project. It is formatted in question/section answer format.

When creating the E/R diagrams I made the assumptions that ratings, tags, and has_genres were relationships while movies, users, and genres are entity sets. Ratings, tags, and has_genre are relationships because they contain the primary keys from the entity sets. Genres is an entity set because it works out better when working with queries. By having a list of all the genres in one place set as a primary key then I can easily check other tables to see if they match certain genres.
A constraint I encountered was with creating the entity set users. In result of userid being a primary key I had to take extra steps to insure no redundancy. To do so I inserted the distinct values from tags and ratings into users. Next, I created a temporary table to take in distinct values from the newly filled users table. After I emptied users and inserted the values from the temporary table, users had the right entries.
